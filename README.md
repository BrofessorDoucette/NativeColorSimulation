This program was intended to create a real-time version of a code my roommate and I had created in python that should be on my gitlab. The code here uses C++ for the real-time performance and OpenGL for the rendering. At the beginning, three pixels are selected to be red, green, and blue respectively. Then in the proceeding frames, the colors will spread out and try to battle eachother to be the dominant color on the map. The battling mechanics is handled by simple probabilities.

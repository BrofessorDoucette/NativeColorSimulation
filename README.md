This program was intended to create a real-time version of a code my roommate and I had created in python. The code here uses C++ and OpenGL. At the beginning, three pixels are selected to be red, green, and blue respectively. Then in the proceeding frames, the colors will spread out and try to battle eachother to be the dominant color on the map. The battling mechanics is handled by simple probabilities.
